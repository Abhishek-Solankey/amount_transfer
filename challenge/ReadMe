# Money Transfer Project

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a money transfer feature between bank accounts. It ensures that:
- Account balances are updated in a thread-safe manner.
- Negative balances are not allowed.
- Notifications are sent to both the sender and recipient.

## Features
- **Concurrency**: The balance changes are made thread-safe by using synchronization to avoid race conditions.
- **Notification**: Each account holder is notified after a transfer is made.
- **Unit Testing**: The code is covered with unit tests, including tests for concurrency, positive, and negative scenarios.

## Further Action Points

- **Enhancements**: Introduce more detailed logging and monitoring for large-scale deployments.
- **Improved Exception Handling**: Implement a more robust error handling framework for better operational insights.
- **Database Integration**: Currently, the project assumes in-memory repositories. Future work can include integration with a database.
- **API Layer**: Build a REST API layer on top of this service for external interaction.
